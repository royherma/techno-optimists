# techno-optimists

Private repo. Own git repo inside `techguyver-side-projects` — **not** a monorepo member.

## Read first

`docs/2026-09-10-concept.md` is the source of truth for what this product is.
Do not restate or re-derive it — link to it.

## Vocabulary (use these exact words)

- **Challenge** — the core object. Not "post", not "project", not "issue".
- A Challenge starts as one of: **Problem**, **Idea**, **Experiment**, **Build**.
- Lifecycle: Spot -> Understand -> Ideas -> Build -> Test -> Learn -> Improve.
- People roles: **Scout**, **Thinker**, **Researcher**, **Builder**, **Expert**, **Tester**.
- Social actions are typed, never a generic Like:
  I have this problem / I want this / I have an idea / I can help / I'll test this /
  I'm building this / Follow progress.

## Product rules

- The feed comes before collaboration. Browsing must be enjoyable before contributing is asked.
- AI is invisible plumbing (transcribe, translate, structure, match). Never an "AI community".
- Not startup-focused, not charity-focused, not future-focused. Fixing an irrigation
  system this afternoon counts.
- Documenting a fascinating problem with no solution is a complete contribution.

## Copy rules

- Never ship "this is a prototype" / "not built yet" into user-facing copy. That goes to Roy.
- Plain words, hyphen not em-dash.

## Code is truth

The code is the only source of truth about what exists. This file, the README and every
doc go stale the moment a commit lands; they describe intent, never state.

- Never report status from a doc. Read the code, run the command, paste the artifact.
- Never say a thing is missing without the grep that found nothing.
- Found a doc that contradicts the code? The doc is wrong. Fix it in the same commit.
- No status or progress sections in this file. `git log` and the code already say it.

## Conventions

- Docs: `docs/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`.
- Secrets: `.env` / `.dev.vars`, both gitignored. Templates are `.env.example`.
- Node version pinned in `.nvmrc`.
